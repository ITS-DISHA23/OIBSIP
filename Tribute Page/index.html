    <h2>Why I Admire Them</h2>
    <p>
      My parents are the strongest people I know. They have made countless
      sacrifices so that I could dream freely and live confidently. Their love,
      patience, and guidance shaped who I am today.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through every challenge, they stood like a shield. Through every success,
      they stood quietly behind me, proud and smiling. Their hard work, values,
      and unconditional support inspire me every single day.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page is a small tribute to express my gratitude, respect, and love for
      the two people who mean the world to me.
